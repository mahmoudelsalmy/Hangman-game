# Hangman Game (C++)

## About the Project
This project is a **multiplayer Hangman game** implemented in **C++**.  
The game allows up to **5 players** to compete by guessing words randomly selected from a predefined word list.  
Each player takes turns, and their score is recorded based on whether they successfully guessed the word.  

This project was developed as part of my **C++ practice** during university to strengthen my understanding of:
- Game logic implementation  
- Arrays and string manipulation  
- Random number generation and input validation

## Features
- Supports up to **5 players**  
- Random word selection from a word library  
- Tracks player scores individually  
- Limited attempts (7) to guess each word  
- Displays progress of the word with `_` for unguessed letters  
- Declares winners and losers at the end
